INTRODUCTION:
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in the field of computer science and mathematics, specifically in the realm of algorithmic and recursive problem-solving. It was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883 and later popularized by the British mathematician and puzzlist Henry Dudeney.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The Tower of Hanoi consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. 
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
•	Only one disk can be moved at a time.
•	Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
•	No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The puzzle is commonly visualized with three rods labeled A, B, and C. The initial configuration has all the disks on rod A, and the goal is to move them to rod C.
